## üí° Overview  

**Dim3** is a powerful **open-source 3D game engine** built natively for **macOS**. Designed with performance and flexibility in mind, Dim3 provides developers with a complete framework for building interactive 3D games, visual experiences, and real-time simulations.  

The engine combines a clean workflow with accessible tools, making it a great choice for both independent developers and educators. Dim3 supports features like **real-time lighting, advanced physics, particle effects, and skeletal animation**, allowing creators to build dynamic and visually appealing projects without expensive commercial software.  

Because it‚Äôs an open-source engine, developers can freely modify the source code to fit their specific needs or integrate their own systems and scripts. Dim3‚Äôs **modular structure** and **intuitive editor** make it especially well-suited for learning 3D game design fundamentals while also offering the flexibility for professional development.  

Optimized for **macOS**, the engine runs smoothly on both **Intel and Apple Silicon processors**, offering a stable, responsive environment for design and testing.
